## New Features:

Hello,

Thank you very much for the clear and detailed answers to my original set of questions. I tried to list out the main functionalities, in accordance with your requests, excluding the International Shipping API - which we may discuss in the future. These are all to be added to the existing system, which will of course need to be adapted to fit this particular use case. 

- Site Builder
	- Should allow the user to add and remove blocks to their page
	- They should also be able to change the content, branding, colors of each element
- Social Media Channels to integrate:
	- Meta (Facebook)
	- Instagram
	- TikTok
- Finance
	- Allow for Different Payment Systems
		- Stripe
		- Paypal
		- Bank Transfer
		- Cash on Delivery
	- *There should always be order traceability*
	- Taxes
		- Allow the seller to define a list of VAT options
			- `Type`: `VAT Amount`
		- Each product should have a VAT option selected, which will let the user/seller see how much VAT he will be payingAT Amount
- Shipping
	- Shipping Options Availability & Pricing
		- Location Based:
			- Allow the seller to define a price for each area and if that method is available there or not
		- Weight Based Pricing:
			- Define weight ranges & price for each range
	- User should see a list of shipping options, which are based on his location (Zip Code), and each have a logo and name, which is defined by the seller
- Quantity
	- Each product can either be:
		- Unlimited Quantity
		- Limited Quantity
	- There should be a minimum threshold, after which the seller is notified
- Review Section
	- Text & Image[] should also be an option
	- Filter the content
- Connect to Amazon / EBay and create products there with the `price = price + (commission% * price)`
- Integration with Google Ads and Analytics
- “Installing” Messenger / WhatsApp
	- Button on the listing page with which customers can ask questions directly about the products
		- Guessing this means that Messenger should know what the product is and have that as context
		- Alternatively the seller provides an account / phone number which will be contacted with a “Template Message” and he can then respond to this query

Please do let me know if there is anything I have missed from the original requirements. 
If not, I can proceed with estimating the duration and total cost of the project, accounting for the new additions.

Thank you,
Best,
Enes
