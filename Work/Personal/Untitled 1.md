Hello Giuseppe,

Thank you for your response. I appreciate you taking the time to share your proposal with me and your thoughts on the project's future.

I'd like to firstly state that I fully agree with you regarding the necessity of continuous communication and the importance of building long-lasting relations, trustful and stable. 

I believe that constant client feedback is necessary, as it is nearly impossible to create the desired end-product without it - so I fully share your stance on team-work and problem solving. I would like to note that, personally I don't see the language barrier as a problem, given that it can be easily overcome through translation solutions. 

Regarding your proposal, my primary concern is the risk I would have to take on if I were to develop all the changes we have discussed in our previous communications. 

The changes we have discussed in our previous communications, solely serve the goal of adapting the existing platform to an e-commerce solution for businesses - a tailored solution for Lead Mobile - instead of the current vision of the platform, which is to be a marketplace for all.

Essentially, per this proposal, myself and other developers, which I would directly engage and pay , would be working to implement new functionality, for the course of 6 months. After this period, if your business is still in need of such a solution, then finally the investment *may* start getting returns. 

The problem however is that, while I remain excited to work on this project, the methodology of work you have proposed leaves me with no assurances that the time and funds I would need to invest, will amount to anything. The risk is exacerbated by the ever-changing landscape of business requirements and market demands. I am not willing to make such a risky investment.

Regarding the price of the platform and the requested changes, I have to unfortunately inform you that it is not possible to meet your desired price point of â‚¬50,000 unless the requirements are to change also.

Otherwise, I am happy to provide you the full source-code of the "Merre" platform, and a full onboarding for the engineers who are implement your business requirements'.

Sincerely,
Enes Bala
