Hello Giorgio,

Thank you for your response. I appreciate you taking the time to explain where you stand and how you view the continuation of our work.

I'd like to firstly state that I fully agree with you regarding the necessity of continuous communication and building work re. I believe that without client feedback, it is nearly impossible to create the desired end-product.
