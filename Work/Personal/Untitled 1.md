Hello Giorgio,

Thank you for your response. I appreciate you taking the time to explain where you stand and how you view the continuation of our work.

I'd like to firstly state that I fully agree with you regarding the necessity of continuous communication and building long-lasting relations. 

I believe that without client feedback, it is nearly impossible to create the desired end-product, so in that sense, I fully understand your stance regarding team-work and problem solving. I would like to note that, personally I don't see the language barrier as a problem, given that it can be easily solved through translation technology. 

Regarding your proposal, my primary concern is the risk I would have to take on if I were to develop all the changes we have discussed in our previous communications. 

The changes we have discussed in our previous communications, solely serve the goal of adapting the existing platform to a  e-commerce solution for businesses (a tailored solution for your business), instead of the current vision of the platform, which is to be a marketplace for all.

Essentially, in the current proposal you have sent, myself and other developers, which I would directly engage and pay in the meanwhile, would be working to implement new functionality, for the course of 6 months. After this period, if your business is still in need of such a solution, then finally the investment *may* start getting returns. 

The problem however is that, while I remain excited to work on this project, the methodology of work you have proposed leaves me with no assurances that the time and funds I would need to invest, will amount to anything. The risk is exacerbated by the ever-changing landscape of business requirements and market demands. I am not willing to make such a risky investment.

Regarding the pricing of theI am happy to provide you the full source code of the existing platform
