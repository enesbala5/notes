Hello Giorgio,

Thank you for your response. I appreciate you taking the time to explain where you stand and how you view the continuation of our work.

I'd like to firstly state that I fully agree with you regarding the necessity of continuous communication and building long-lasting relations. 

I believe that without client feedback, it is nearly impossible to create the desired end-product, so in that sense, I fully understand your stance regarding team-work and problem solving. I would like to note that, personally I don't see the language barrier as a problem, given that it can be easily solved through translation technology. 

Regarding your proposal, my primary concern is the risk I would have to take on if I were to develop all the changes we spoke of, and have written down in our previous communications. 

I am not willin
