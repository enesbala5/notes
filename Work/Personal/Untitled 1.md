Hello Giorgio,

Thank you for your response. I appreciate you taking the time to explain where you stand and how you view the continuation of our work.

I'd like to firstly state that I fully agree with you regarding the necessity of continuous communication and building long-lasting relations. 

I believe that without client feedback, it is nearly impossible to create the desired end-product, so in that sense, I fully understand your stance regarding team-work and problem solving. I would like to note that, personally I don't see the language barrier as a problem, given that it can be easily solved through translation technology. 

Regarding your proposal, my primary concern is the risk I would have to take on if I were to develop all the changes we have discussed in our previous communications. 

The changes we have discussed in detail in our previous communications, solely serve the new goal of adapting the existing platform to an e-commerce solution for businesses, instead of the current vision of a marketplace for all.

Essentially, myself and other developers, which I would engage in the project, would have to work in implementing new functionality to the platform to fit your business needs'. While I would be happy to do this with clearly defined
