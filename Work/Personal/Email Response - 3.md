Hi Giuseppe,

I read your message and I think it is now a bit more clear to me. 

In your last email you noted that Lead Mobile is in need of a "SAAS e-commerce platform" - which it may acquire and look to finally own. However, I donâ€™t have a SaaS to sell, as it has yet to be built.

It is my understanding that you believe I am not yet fully knowledgeable about your vision for the platform. You are right.
For that reason, I expect you to do the prep work for the procurement of the product and to draft the ToRs (Terms of Reference) of this mandate. 

I do not believe it's possible to proceed unless the project requirements are written down, as the work has to be clearly defined
As this is pure engineering, I expect to clarify things in writing. 
Once the modules of the platform shall be operational according to your basic requirements, we may discuss on regular calls specific improvements likely size and colour of components or small upgrades in functionalities. (Usually a project is reviewed within the same quotation for up to 10% of its working time).

Once I have received your TORs on the product including:
- Preliminary design or model to imitate in looks
- Business flow (functionalities for the users and the detailed passages of the UI/UX according to services offered)
- Technical details related to volumes of data and their processing from the admin point of view
- Timeline required and preferred structure (modular or other)

Once I shall receive this documents from you, I shall undergo again the process of quotation.
Surely I shall evaluate which part of the existing modules of my current product may serve your vision. This may positively affect the time of delivery.

In order to save your time I would invite you to write down the Terms of Reference (which you should already have I suppose) and we take it from there.

Consider please this approach, dear Mr Giuseppe - as a from scratch quotation process (as you have asked me to do in your previous message).

Looking forward to have your documents, i remain

With regards
Enes
