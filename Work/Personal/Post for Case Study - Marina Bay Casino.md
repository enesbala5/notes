Developers are infamous for failing to share the work they do - and I'm no exception to this rule. However, lately I've decided to start building in public and publish my projects online. I will try my best to stay consistent to this goal.

I believe that without proper sampling, the only person who will find value in your work, is you - I look forward to feedback and criticism, constructive or not.

In that spirit, I'll start by sharing a project I finished recently - a website for MARITIM Marina Bay - a hotel located in Vlore, Albania. For the past 2 years, I've helped them manage their hotel's website and develo new functionalities to better serve their clients.

They launched the first casino in the South of Albania, and for this new venture, they needed a beautiful website to accompany it - while also reflecting the brand values of quality, luxury and excellence.
I prepared a case study to document the steps taken and highlighting the final product, which you can find below:

Iâ€™ll be adding more case studies from other projects soon - and look forward to all feedback regarding the project and it's documentation.

I found that returning to a project is a great way to learn more on the successes and failures, allowing you to reflect on what worked, and what might need improving
