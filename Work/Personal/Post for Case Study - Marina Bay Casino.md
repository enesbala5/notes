Developers are infamous for failing to sharing the work they do - and I'm no exception to this rule. However, lately I've decided to put more effort to building in public and publishing my projects so others can actually understand who I am and what I do. 

Without proper sampling, the only person who will find value in your work, is you - I look forward to feedback and criticism, constructive or not.

In that spirit, I'll start by sharing a project I finished recently - a website for MARITIM Marina Bay - a hotel located in Vlore, Albania.
I have had the pleasure of working with Marina Bay for the past 2 years, helping them manage their hotel's website and developing new functionalities to better serve their clients.

I prepared a case study to document the Marina Bay Casino website project, which is now up on my portfolio.

Iâ€™ll be adding more case studies from other projects soon. Let me know what you think!

I found that returning to a project is a great way to learn more on the successes and failures, allowing you to reflect on what worked, and what might need improving
