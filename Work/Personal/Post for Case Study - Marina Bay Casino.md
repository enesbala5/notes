Developers are infamous for failing to sharing the work they do - and I'm no exception to this rule. However, lately I've tried to put more effort to building in public and publishing my projects so others can actually understand who I am and what I do.

I've always admired people who despite of the criticism they may face, alfwas. I believe such a mindset is necessary, if you are to have any impact and create things that are worthwhile.

recently finished a website for MARITIM Marina Bay Casino - which I am very proud to share with you. I prepared a case study to document the project, which is now up on my portfolio.

I found that returning to a project is a great way to learn more on the successes and failures, allowing you to reflect on what worked, and what might need improving

Iâ€™ll be adding more case studies from other projects soon. Let me know what you think!
