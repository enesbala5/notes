I recently built a website for Marina Bay Casino - I prepared a Case Study which is up on my personal portfolio
I am very happy to share this with you and hope to get feedback
I am currently updating my portfolio with case studies from my recent projects and will be sharing them along the way

Developers are infamous for failing to sharing the work they do - and I'm no exception to this rule. However, lately I've decided to put more effort to building in public and publishing my projects so others can actually understand who I am and what I do. 

I look forward to criticism, constructive or not. Without proper sampling, the only person who will find value in your work, is you.

In that spirit, I'll start by sharing a project I finished recently - a website for MARITIM Marina Bay Casino - built with Sveltekit and Strapi

I prepared a case study to document the project, which is now up on my portfolio.

Iâ€™ll be adding more case studies from other projects soon. Let me know what you think!

I found that returning to a project is a great way to learn more on the successes and failures, allowing you to reflect on what worked, and what might need improving
