Create an image of a square card (where I will edit in a logo) connecting to a server through the cloud and internet
There should be a link between a square card and a server with beams across them to indicate a connection
The empty card and the server should be away from each other - the server should look like a computer and the card should just be a white box

If you have ever self-hosted with Coolify and own a home server, this is for you. Here's a full guide to connecting your home server as a node to your main Coolify instance.

Let me know if anything in unclear - looking for feedback!
